# AttendanceChecker

## Project Description
This project was created in collaboration with the Engaging Girls in Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing (GUIC) Summer Camp initiative as part of the National Scientist Foundation-funded UNLV ITEST project. 

Objective: Students will make an attendance checking system to efficiently take attendance in a
SMART classroom.

Applications: Traditional attendance can be time-consuming, with teachers roll calling or using
a seating chart to ensure students are present. This process is known to shift the focus and
learning in the classroom. An automatic attendance checker is not time-demanding and allows
teachers to focus on instruction. The automatic attendance checker allows for a smooth learning
process and greater security in the classroom.
